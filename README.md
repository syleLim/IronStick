Iron Stick
===

## Explain
Do cut amount of iron Sticks using laser. For effcient work, stack iron sticks and perpendiculary shoot laser above sticks to cut. Arrangement of sticks and lasers is guided next rule.

```
1. Small stick is only put above long stick
2. Must put stick perfactly overlapping bottom stick, but end points doesnt overlapp
3. At least a laser cutting each stick.
4. Laser dont overlap any end points of sticks
```

Below Image is sample of arrangement. Thick lines are sticks, points are positions of lasers. dot line is laser's direction.

This arrangement is represented by using brackets.
```
(a) Laser is represented closed bracket '()'
(b) Stick is represented witdh bracket, '(' is left end point of sitck, ')' is right end point.
```

"()(((()())(())()))(())" represent sameple arrangement above.

You write the solution that return how many sticks are made after cutting.

Ex > "()(((()())(())()))(())"  : return (17)

### Rule
1. function name is solution
2. make an effort to use low level function
